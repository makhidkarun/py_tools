Coding Standards
==============

Style
-----

I've developed my own coding standards that work for me.  However, 
not everyone uses the same standards. At this point I'm going to 
go re-read PEP-8 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and start
bringing my code in line with that. 

Thoughts?


Python 2 vs Python 3
--------------------

As much as possible I code to work on both Python 2 and 3. A lot of 
my effort is to be able to write system tools for RHEL boxes. 


stdlib
------

Mostly want to stay with the python standard library unless there is 
a good reason not to. Or is the expected usage that people are happy to
install more modules.
