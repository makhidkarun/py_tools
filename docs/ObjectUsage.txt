Reading "Object-Oriented Analysis and Design" by Grady Booch.
Good stuff as I'm trying to learn more OOP.

class Character
  Character is the main class. An instance of character has data that 
    coversattributes like name, statistics, skills, careers, etc.
  Various use cases extend the number of attributes.
  Methods in the class check bounds and organize generation.

class Career
  Working on careers as something a Character instance is passed to.
  The Character is modified in place.
  The Career has data on skills, muster-out benefits, etc.
  Each specific career like "Navy" should be a subclass of Career.

class Presenter
  Takes a Character instance and outputs it according to the format.
  Subclassed (?) for sql, json, html, etc.
